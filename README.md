## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this one I mainly learned how to use the css filter properties to apply colours on svg items. Also implemented pseudo elements for the first time.

### Continued development

I'd like to take what I learnt design wise with grid and psuedo elements and apply them in future projects.
